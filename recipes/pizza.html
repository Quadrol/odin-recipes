            This basic cheese pizza recipe on its own is already delicious, but

            could be replaced with an alfredo sauce or pesto or even a light drizzle
            of olive oil!

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 400 degreed Farenheit.</li>
                <li>*Note* If pizza dough is frozen, thaw in fridge overnight.
                    Put parchment paper on a sheet pan and flatten out the pizza dough
                    trying to keep a uniform thickness. Work the dough out from the center 
                    towards the edges. <strong>Your pizza can be round or square!</strong>
                </li>
                <li>Spread a thin layer of sauce ontop of the dough, leaving some room around
                    the edger for a crust to form.
                </li>
                <li>Sprinkle your cheese of choice ontop of the sauce. It's ok for some cheese
                    to fall on the crust, it will crisp up and make the crust extra tasty!
                </li>
                <li>(Optional)Sprinklke additional toppings ontop of cheese. Toppings can also
                    be layered under or between cheese layers!
                </li>
                <li>Bake on sheetpan untill cheese is melted and browns a little. Time will very 
                    depending on thickness of crust.
                </li>
            </ol>
